	     Infrastructure configuration to support system testing the rewards application.
	
		 These beans are defined in a separate file to isolate infrastructure config from application config,
		 as infrastructure often varies between environments.  For example, in a test environment you
		 might use a lightweight in-memory DataSource, while in production you connect to a database server
		 with a connection pool.
